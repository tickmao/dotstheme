## [HOW TO TALK TO YOUR CUSTOMERS](http://howtomarketagame.com/2020/02/17/how-to-talk-to-your-customers/)

如果可以，你可以选择多于你的粉丝交流，你总能识别出一些比较活跃的用户，争取每周与至少一个用户聊一下（尽量语音通话）。你会比其他99% 的游戏开发者更了解你的用户。如果有人问你你的目标观众是谁，你不会得到愚蠢的回答“ uuuuuh，所有的玩家。”

因为如果玩家足够活跃，那说明其对游戏的了解更强，那么你们就有了共同的话题来开展。这要远比撒网式调研，诸如目前国内常常在用户手机号注册之后就进行访问要好的多。

### 如何找到对应的粉丝？

找那些经常反馈给你的用户，诸如各类社交平台的交流。

### 交流方式？

最好语言通信的方式，诸如电话等等。其一，主要是更加高效，减少时间。其二，用户不见得能很好的把握自己的需求，你需要在沟通中明白他的想法，文字是冰冷的，尤其是在对陌生人开场时，是非常谨慎的回复。

### 如果项目未开启，如何找目标用户？

选择你产品所对标的对应竞品，找到他的非垃圾或营销用户，去聊聊他们觉得还需要改进的地方。有助于知道用户的哪些点还未被满足，而这正是你需要去解决的问题。


> In my 1×1 interview I try and get a few key things answered.

How did they find my game and me? – I ask this because I am curious as to what in my marketing is working or if there is some other place I should be concentrating.
How they bought it? What sale? Was it a bundle? Did a friend give it to them? – I ask this because it also helps me figure out the proper marketing channels.
What their history of gaming is and what their favorite genres? What is currently your favorite game? – In all my Steam research I have found that people stick closely to a handful of genres. This question helps me understand what other games I should be looking out for as comparison and what potential new genres I should explore.
What is the next improvement I should make to 1 Screen Platformer? – I ask this question instead of asking “how do you like my game?” Because everyone is going to say “it’s fine.” But phrasing it this way ensures that they give me an honest and useful answer.
What social media site is their favorite to use? – Again this helps me identify what social media channels to target. I say favorite because a lot of people sign up for all of them but only use 1 or 2.
What developers do you follow or discords are you part of? – This helps me know if there are any other devs to reach out to so we can potentially enter into a cross-promotion or co-marketing effort.
Where do you learn about new games? Streamers? News sites? – More information about marketing channels. Potential streamer partnerships.
